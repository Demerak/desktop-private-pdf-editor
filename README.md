# Private Desktop Application PDF Editor üìÑ
## Overview
---
I don't often need to edit PDFs, but when I do, it's usually for simple tasks like removing a page ‚úÇÔ∏è or merging PDFs üìë, and I often turn to Python for these tasks. However, this isn't convenient for most, and since it's a complaint I've heard repeatedly over the years, I've decided to create a desktop application üñ•Ô∏è that can address these issues.

While there are already numerous open-source projects that offer similar functionality to what I'm aiming for, most of them are web applications. I prefer downloading a desktop application to manipulate my PDFs, so that's the goal of this project.

I started exploring the Tauri framework üõ†Ô∏è in early 2024, as it gained significant traction in 2023 over Electron. I've previously used it for a project involving data from my car, and my experience was excellent, so I decided to utilize the same framework for this project. Even though JavaScript is well known not to be an efficient programming language, there are a ton of desktop applications that wouldn't exist without it. A really popular application is Discord and it was made using Electron. The main appeal of these two frameworks is the ability to create applications for major desktop platforms with a single codebase. I see the value in that and that's why I decided to use it again for this project.
